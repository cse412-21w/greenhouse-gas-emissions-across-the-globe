      <h1> Overall Introduction </h1>
      In the process of thinking what we wanted our project to be about, we all came together to decide with the idea of climate change.
      What we decided what we wanted to highlight in each of our visualizations was how different factors contributed to the different parts of climate.
      And have a good visualization to be able to see correlations between different factors, and factors that might directly affect climate change. Hopefull our visualizations givee a better understanding of the different measures of climate change, and certain elements such as CO2 emission that directly affect our earth.
