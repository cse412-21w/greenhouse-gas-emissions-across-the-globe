### Contribution Statements
Alexander Thomson: Created the three interactive CO2 emissions maps included in emissions.html, emissions2.html, emissions3.html. Wrote the conclusion.

Faisal Alsallum: Created the global surface-ocean index/world average CO2 emission comparison visual in globaltemp.html, the average yearly temperature map in globalatemp2.html, the plot showing the change in sea level in globaltemp3.html, and the plot showing the predicted effects of a 1m sea level increases on country GDP found in globaltemp4.html.

Steven Wilson: Created the CO2 emissions versus GDP interactive visualization in gdp.html.

Jeremiah Cheng: Created the website where we posted our visualizations.

## Project Proposal Abstract
Originally, for this project, we decided to investigate the topic climate change as it is both currently a pressing issue for the modern world and will likely remain so for the foreseeable future. In our webpage, we broke down our presentation of the problem into two sections. In one section we visually present the topic of global warming, its relationship with increased carbon dioxide emissions, and the rising sea level, one of its more general effects, so that an otherwise uniformed viewer might better understand the issue. In the other half of our website, we explore how the various countries across the globe are contributing to global warming via their yearly CO2 emissions and see how factors such as population and GDP affect those figures.
