          Throughout this visualization we’ve not only seen how increased carbon dioxide emissions have been influencing global temperature which in turn leads to rising sea levels, but we’ve also seen how each country has been contributing to this problem over the past few decades. We’ve seen that two countries, the United States and China contribute by far the most overall to these emissions. However, once we start taking into account factors such as population and GDP, the distribution of CO2 emissions, at least in more recent years, appear far more balanced across the globe, though the U.S. and China certainly still stand out using those figures as well. Instead, we begin see subtler aspects of the data, how the North America, parts of Europe, Australia, and the Arabian Peninsula all per person release more CO2 than the rest of the world and only recently have countries in Asia begun to catch up. We see how many Asian countries with initially low GDPs released disproportionate amounts of CO2 until their GDP rose to the point that those emissions were instead inline with the rest of the globe. This same relationship between wealth and CO2 emissions then appears when we investigate CO2 per capita versus GDP per capita for countries with various income levels yet we also see that high income countries have kept their CO2 emissions per capita relatively constant as their GDPs per capita have increased. We hope that after looking through these visualizations that you now have a better understanding of not only the issue of climate change but also some of the global trends in emissions that led up to this point and that will likely persist into the foreseeable future.
