    <h1>GDP Per Capita over Time and CO2 Emissions</h1>

       This plot shows GDP per Capita versus CO2 per Capita for High Income, Low Income, Upper Middle Income, and Lower Middle Income countries from 1960 to 2016. The trends in this plot reveal that there is correlation between how rich a country is and how much it emits CO2. In general, as a country becomes richer it results in higher CO2 emissions. This could be because countries generally become more industrialized to increase their GDP, resulting in higher emissions. This plot also shows that “High Income” countries have been able to increase their GDPs while keeping their CO2 emissions relatively constant. This could point to there being a certain threshold of when countries no longer increase their emissions to increase their GDP. As well, an interesting trend to note is that as time goes on all of the country sets are starting to flatten out, indicating increased wealth with decreasing emissions.
